# Apple Vision Pro Clone

## Overview
This project is a clone of the **Apple Vision Pro**, showcasing an eye-catching user interface and smooth interactions. The clone aims to replicate the design and functionality of the original product, providing a hands-on learning experience in web development.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the UI components.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity.
- **GSAP** (GreenSock Animation Platform): For creating smooth animations and transitions.
- **LocomotiveJS**: For implementing smooth scrolling effects and scroll-triggered animations.

## Features
- Responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes.
- Scroll-triggered animations that enhance user engagement.
- Image rendering that mimics video playback through scrolling.
- Eye-catching UI inspired by the latest Apple Vision Pro design.

## Project Status
The project is currently **85% complete**. While the core features and design elements are implemented, further enhancements and refinements will be made in the future. Many aspects of the project rely on the same concepts already established, which is why I have chosen not to finalize it completely at this time.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance CSS design logic to improve visual consistency and responsiveness.
- Implement additional features and refine existing animations.
- Optimize performance for smoother scrolling and rendering.
